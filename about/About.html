            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Andrew, Eamonn, and Michael are all dog lovers and often found themselves missing out on activities because they
                didn't have a place to bring their furry friends. Determined to change this, they decided to open a dog-friendly cafe in the heart of the city.</p>
    
                
                <p> They worked tirelessly to make their dream a reality. They scouted out the perfect location on Lower Mayor Street, and set about transforming it into a warm and welcoming space for both
                humans and canines. The cafe was named "Bran agus Sce贸lang" after Fionn MacCumhail's two wolf hounds. </p>
            

                <p>The atmosphere in Bran agus Sce贸lang was lively and inviting, with comfortable seating areas for both dogs and their owners. There were plenty of toys and treats available for the dogs, and a menu full of
                delicious food and drinks that were sure to please even the pickiest of palates. </p> 
                

                <p>The guys are always on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly and that all their customers have a great time. They take pride in knowing each and every one of their customers by
                name, and their furry friends too! The cafe has quickly become a hub for dog owners and enthusiasts.</p>

                 
                <p>Andrew, Eamonn, and Michael are thrilled to see their dream become a reality and are grateful for the support of their
                customers. They take great care in ensuring that every detail is perfect, from the comfortable seating areas to the freshly baked treats available for both dogs and humans..</p>
